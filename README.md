## 🏗️ **Architecture Highlights**

### **Advanced State Management**
- **useReducer + Context API** instead of basic useState
- Centralized state architecture with predictable updates
- No prop drilling - clean component hierarchy
- Action-based state mutations (similar to Redux patterns)

### **Scalable Architecture**
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Separation of concerns with clear folder structure
- Component composition over inheritance
- Future-ready for complex features like real-time updates

### **Why This Approach?**
While most todo apps use simple `useState`, this project demonstrates:
- How to handle complex state interactions
- Professional-level React patterns used in production apps
- Scalable foundation that can grow into larger applications
